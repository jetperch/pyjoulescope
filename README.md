Welcome to the Joulescopeâ„¢ python driver!  
[Joulescope](https://www.joulescope.com) is an affordable, precision DC energy 
analyzer that enables you to build better products. 

This pyjoulescope python package enables you to
automate Joulescope operation and easily measure current, voltage, power and
energy within your own Python programs.
With the Joulescope driver, controlling your Joulescope is easy.  The following
example captures 0.1 seconds of data and then prints the average current
and voltage:

    import joulescope
    import numpy as np
    with joulescope.scan_require_one(config='auto') as js:
        data = js.read(contiguous_duration=0.1)
    current, voltage = np.mean(data, axis=0, dtype=np.float64)
    print(f'{current} A, {voltage} V')

This package also installs the "joulescope" command line tool:

    joulescope --help

Most Joulescope users will run the graphical user interface which is in the 
[pyjoulescope_ui](https://github.com/jetperch/pyjoulescope_ui) package and
available for [download](https://www.joulescope.com/download).
